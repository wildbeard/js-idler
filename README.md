### Why This Looks Like Shit

Okay so I am writing this code on a computer that I can't use JS runtimes like Node on.

Everything is in one single file because using `fetch` on local filesystems is now considered CORS and I honestly just can't be bothered to care about dealing with that.

Could I create multiple script files, bind variables to the window, and access them that way? Absolutely.
Will I? No.

### Why Am I Doing This?

Gotta stay sane at work somehow. I have freetime and I've always liked the idea of an idle/clicker game.

### Is There Any Goal?

No.

### Is There Any Plan?

No.

### Why Are You Using JS and Not TS?

No.

### A Final Note

I am using vsc\*de and I am ***not*** even remotely enjoying it. I tried using the Vim emulator plugin, but for some reason there is a ***lot*** of input lag the longer I leave vsc\*de open. Perhaps it has to do with the spyware, I mean "security" tools, running on this work machine. Or maybe it's just that vsc\*de sucks.
